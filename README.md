Knowledge-base Search Engine
 Overview

The Knowledge-base Search Engine is an intelligent information retrieval system designed to search across multiple documents (text or PDF) and provide synthesized, context-aware answers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).

This system combines semantic search, vector embeddings, and LLM-based summarization to create a human-like search experience — offering concise, accurate responses derived from the provided knowledge sources.

 Objective

To develop a robust document-aware question-answering system that:

Ingests and processes multiple documents (PDFs or text files).

Retrieves the most relevant content using semantic search.

Synthesizes answers intelligently using an integrated LLM.

 Scope of Work

Input: Multiple text or PDF documents.

Process:

Preprocess documents (chunking, embedding creation).

Store embeddings in a vector database.

Use LLM prompting to generate concise, factual responses.

Output: Contextual and summarized answers to user queries.

Optional Frontend: A web interface for document upload and query interaction.

 Technical Architecture
 Components

Backend API:
Handles document ingestion, query processing, and communication between the embedding model and LLM.

Information Retrieval Layer:
Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using embedding-based vector similarity search.

Answer Synthesis:
Integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) such as Gemini 1.5 Flash or OpenAI GPT to synthesize concise and contextually relevant answers.

Embedding Model:
Uses sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for semantic embedding generation.

🧠 LLM Prompting Example

“Using the following documents, answer the user’s question succinctly and accurately.”

This guiding prompt ensures that responses are context-grounded, coherent, and factually consistent with the input data.
